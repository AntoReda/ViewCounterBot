# View Counter Bot
FB marketplace bot
This bot takes as input the username, password and number of hours you would like it to run for and will record the views for listing you put up.

I included a process that saves the views every hour and graphs the results using matplotlib library. 
The bot also sends a message on discord when it is finished and displays screenshots of the results and the listing.

I created this program using Python to run mainly Selenium based commands to record the number of views for a product you are selling.
